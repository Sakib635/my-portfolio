## About Me

I am a Research Associate in Software Engineering at the University of Windsor. My research focuses on **software dependency management, program analysis, and the use of Large Language Models for automated debugging, repair, and reproducibility of Python software systems**.

I am passionate about designing tools and methodologies that enhance software reliability and reproducibility. My work has led to publications at **IEEE/ACM MSR 2025**, **AIP Conference Proceedings 2024**, and my **Master’s thesis**.

I am seeking to pursue a **PhD in Software Engineering**, focusing on software analysis, tooling, and AI-assisted software development.
