## About Me

I am a Research Associate in Software Engineering at the University of Windsor, where my work centers on **software dependency management**, **program analysis**, and leveraging **large language models (LLMs)** for automated debugging and program repair.

My research bridges empirical software engineering with AI-driven techniques to create more reliable, maintainable, and intelligent tools for developers. I am actively pursuing a **PhD in Software Engineering** (or related areas such as automated software engineering, SE4AI, or programming languages/systems), with strong interest in advanced analysis, developer tooling, and AI-assisted workflows.

I hold an **M.Sc. in Computer Science** (University of Windsor, 2023–2025) and a **B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering** (BRAC University, 2018–2022). My graduate work applied computational mathematics to dependency ecosystem challenges, while my undergraduate thesis developed a deep learning–powered virtual teaching assistant.

I'm passionate about using AI to make software engineering more productive and less error-prone. If our research interests align, feel free to reach out — I'm open to collaborations, discussions, or PhD-related opportunities.
